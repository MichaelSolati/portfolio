I did my first coding bootcamp in the Summer of 2015, and it wasn‚Äôt long after that I landed my first job as a Meteor developer and got to speak at the NYC Meteor Meetup. It was to an audience of well over 80 people, and after that experience, I knew I was hooked.

Teaching, talking and sharing my experiences as a developer was becoming my passion and I pursued this from Connecticut to New York, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and even Toronto, Canada. Fast forward almost exactly three years from my first time getting up on a stage, and now I get to advocate amazing software and my experiences as a freshly picked Developer AÃµvÃµoÃµcÃµaÃµdÃµoÃµ Advocate for [Typeform](https://developer.typeform.com).

> So what is it that I actually do now as a Developer Advocate?

The role is super broad with a wide array of responsibilities that can change drastically on a daily basis. Besides the conference speaking I‚Äôve done in the past, added to my responsibilities are writing blog posts (you‚Äôre reading one right now), trying to help people on StackOverflow ([have an issue? use the Typeform tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typeform)), and most excitingly: experimenting!

This is something I‚Äôve had the chance to do already, just a month or so ago I was able to build an interactive story for the Google Home using Typeform! It was a fun ‚Äúchoose your own scare‚Äù style game, [which you can read about here](https://dev.to/michaelsolati/telling-a-typeform-story-on-the-google-assistant-3eaf).

So what has week one like for me? Well, a few things:

1. There has been a bit of onboarding, learning about the product and meeting my team.
2. I‚Äôm getting to work on a fun side MaaS (Memes as a Service) product using Typeform to collect user data and then the Typeform Webhooks to handle some of the secret sauce for the service (details to come).
3. I also [spoke at my first event](https://twitter.com/picsoung/status/1088547731751165952) as a Developer Advocate at ForwardJS. It was exciting and nerve-wracking (but all was well with some encouragement from my mentor Nicolas Greni√© as well as a close friend).
4. I‚Äôm also planning my first trip to Boulder, Colorado. Typeform is sponsoring [HackCU](https://hackcu.org/), and I‚Äôm excited to be able to see what these talented students have (and to stress for the students‚Ä¶ I remember what these are like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm wearing a MLH shirt right now, it wasn‚Äôt that long ago for me).

It‚Äôs exciting, it‚Äôs cool, and it‚Äôs everything I could have dreamed of. I‚Äôm not sure what next month will be like for me, but I can say that it looks exciting!

If you want to keep up with everything I‚Äôm doing you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelSolati), or if you‚Äôre thinking _‚ÄúShow me the code!‚Äù_, You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelSolati) as well.
